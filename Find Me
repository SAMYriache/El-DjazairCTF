# CTF Write-Up: Find Me Challenge

**Author:** COn4n
**Category:** OSINT
**Date:** May 25, 2025
**Challenge Description:** The "Find Me" challenge presents a riddle with three clues: "Bot,"
"Memes," and "Tropical." The goal is to identify the target based on these clues, supported
by six images provided as hints. Let's break it down step by step.
**Clue Analysis**

1. **Bot** : This suggests we are looking for a Discord bot, as bots are commonly used on
    this platform for various functionalities.
2. **Memes** : Indicates the bot is related to memes, likely capable of sharing or managing
    meme content (videos, pictures, etc.).
3. **Tropical** : This could imply a theme or name associated with tropical elements, such
    as pineapples, beaches, or exotic vibes.
**Image Analysis**
● **Image 1 (the second bot in the search bar)** : This image shows a list of bots on a
Discord bot directory, with "Tropical Bot" and "Memes bot" highlighted. The second
bot in the search results is "Memes bot," which aligns with the "Bot" and "Memes"
clues.
● **Image 2 (meme bot with Tropical image)** : This image displays the "Memes bot"
profile, featuring a pineapple icon and a description mentioning it as the "First Arabic
bot for memes (videos + pictures)." The tropical theme is evident from the pineapple,
connecting to the "Tropical" clue.


● **Image 3 (Discord profile of the creator, y.abderrahmane)** : This shows the Discord
profile of "COn4n" (y.abderrahmane), a developer skilled in JavaScript, TypeScript,
and Python, who created the challenge. This confirms the author's identity but
doesn't directly point to the target.
● **Image 4 (y.abderrahmane as the creator)** : This image reinforces that
y.abderrahmane is one of the creators of the "Memes bot," listed alongside b2raa and


tt4k. This ties the creator to the bot.
● **Image 5 (Discord of the bot)** : This image shows the "Memes Support" Discord
server. The server is linked to the bot, providing context for its community.
● **Image 6 (the flag in the Discord bot salon soon)** : This image captures the "#soon"
channel in the "Memes Support" server, with a message saying "Bienvenue dans
#soon! Cest le début du salon #soon.
El-DjazairCTF{Oh_YOU_f0und_MY_mEMes_b0t}." The flag is embedded in this
message.


**Solution Process**
The clues "Bot," "Memes," and "Tropical" point to a Discord bot focused on memes with a
tropical theme. Image 1 and Image 2 highlight "Memes bot" and its tropical pineapple icon,
making it the prime candidate. Image 4 confirms y.abderrahmane's involvement in creating
this bot. The final piece is Image 6, which contains the flag in the "#soon" channel of the
"Memes Support" server, directly tied to the bot.
**Flag**
The flag extracted from Image 6 is:
El-DjazairCTF{Oh_YOU_f0und_MY_mEMes_b0t}
**Conclusion**
The "Find Me" challenge cleverly uses a combination of bot functionality, thematic hints, and
Discord server context to guide the solver. The target is the "Memes bot" with a tropical
theme, and the flag is revealed in the associated Discord server's "#soon" channel. Good
luck to all future solvers!
