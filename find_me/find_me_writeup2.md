## Challenge Information
- **Challenge Name:** Find Me
- **Author:** COn4n
- **Category:** OSINT/Investigation
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Date:** May 25, 2025

## Challenge Description
The "Find Me" challenge presents a simple but intriguing riddle with three clues:
- **Bot**
- **Memes** 
- **Tropical**

The goal is to find what these three clues are pointing to and capture the flag.

## Initial Analysis

Looking at the three clues, I needed to find something that connects all three concepts:
- **Bot** - Likely a Discord bot or similar automated service
- **Memes** - Related to meme content or sharing
- **Tropical** - Could be a theme, name, or visual element

## Solution Process

### Step 1: Research Phase
I started by searching for combinations of these terms to see what would come up. A Google search for "Bot Memes Tropical" yielded interesting results.

The search revealed two potential candidates:
- **Tropical Bot** - A multifunctional Discord bot
- **Memes bot** - A bot specifically for memes

### Step 2: Investigating the Memes Bot
The "Memes bot" seemed like the most promising lead since it directly matched two of our clues. I found it on Discord bot directories.

Perfect match! The "Memes bot" had:
- ‚úÖ **Bot** - It's a Discord bot
- ‚úÖ **Memes** - Specifically designed for memes (videos + pictures)  
- ‚úÖ **Tropical** - Uses a pineapple emoji (üçç) as its icon/theme

Key details discovered:
- Name: "Memes bot üçç"
- Description: "First Arabic bot for memes (videos + pictures) This bot will make your server active !!"
- Rating: 4.1 stars
- The pineapple clearly represents the "tropical" element

### Step 3: Finding the Creator
I investigated who created this bot to understand more about it.

Found the creator's Discord profile:
- Username: **COn4n** (y.abderrahmane)
- Developer with skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python
- Joined Discord 7 years ago

The bot has multiple creators:
- b2raa
- tt4k  
- y.abderrahmane

### Step 4: Locating the Discord Server
Every Discord bot typically has a support server. I found references to the bot's community.

Key information discovered:
- Server count: 187 servers
- Official website: bot.arb-memes.com
- Has a Discord Support Server

### Step 5: Accessing the Support Server
I joined the "Memes Support" Discord server and explored the channels.

**SUCCESS!** In the #soon channel, I found the welcome message containing the flag:

```
Bienvenue dans #soon ! 
C'est le d√©but du salon #soon. El-DjazairCTF{Oh_YOU_f0und_MY_mEMes_b0t}
```

## Flag
```
El-DjazairCTF{Oh_YOU_f0und_MY_mEMes_b0t}
```

## Solution Summary

The three clues led me to identify the **"Memes bot"** Discord bot:
1. **Bot** ‚Üí Discord bot platform
2. **Memes** ‚Üí Bot's primary function (sharing memes)
3. **Tropical** ‚Üí Pineapple theme/icon (üçç)

The flag was hidden in the welcome message of the bot's support Discord server in the #soon channel.

- OSINT challenges often require following a logical chain of discoveries
